# How I create this project

#### Create developing environment
I created a local folder to host all the files for this project called envoy-challenge.

I initialized a git repo by running git init from inside this just created folder and made the initial commit.

The I logged in to my github account and create the remote repository with the same name and add as origin to the local repo.  For now on, after each commit, I push every commit online to keep a saved version of the project on my Github.
