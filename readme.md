# How I create this project

#### Creating the developing environment
The directions state that I must use gulp, bourbon and neat, so here is a lost of libraries and frameworks we will be including:

1. npm
2. Gulp
3. Browsersync
4. Gulp Sass
5. Bourbon
6. Neat

I previously had installed npm and gulp on my computer but if not, you will need to install that software beforehand.

I created a local folder to host the project called envoy-challenge.

first things first, I initialized a git repo by running git init from inside this folder and made the initial commit. Next, I logged in to my github account and created the remote repository with the same name and added as origin to the local repo.  For now on, after each commit, I push every commit online to keep a saved version of the project on my Github.

##### NPM

I started by running npm init inside the folder to create the package.json file, during this process you will be ask several questions, you don't have tp provided those anwsers now. 

##### Gulp

Gulp is next, this will automate tasks like compiling our SASS to CSS code so browser can interpret the stylesheets.

Next is to create the Gulpfile.js file, we will add here the tasks to be automatize, define gulp and start writting the tasks.

##### SASS

Next we need to install SASS, define it in our gulpfile and added the task.

##### Bourbon & Neat

Finally we install bourbon and neat to the project, define them on gulpfile.js and create the tasks.
